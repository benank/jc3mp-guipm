# jc3mp-guipm
Simple GUI to send and receive private messages.  Default key is F8 to open and close GUI. Press Enter to send messages. Draggable using the top of the window.

## Installation
Just drop it in your packages directory, and you're done!

## Bugs
 - Pressing keys such as `T`, `V`, or `M` while typing in the GUI will activate the chat and respective spawn menus.  [This will be fixed once it can be fixed.](https://gitlab.nanos.io/jc3mp/bugs/issues/274)
 - Notification/sound toggles do not save. [This will be fixed in the next update.](https://gitlab.nanos.io/jc3mp/bugs/issues/61)
 
## Todo
 - Add avatars somewhere.
 - Redo leftside visuals, maybe with avatars.
 - Sort player list alphabetically.
 - Make selected player a different color in left side.
